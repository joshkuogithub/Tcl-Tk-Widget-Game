# Tcl/Tk Widget-Game Project

Gam Description
------------------------------
Thi is a simple piece of Tcl code of a widget game.
In the game you and you opponent filp cards in turn and try to remember them before they turn back over.
If you have good memory or simply good luck, you gain score if two successive cars have the same number on it.
Let's call this game the CONCENTRATION! Because you need it in playing the game.

Your opponent in current setting is an AI who can remember all the cards it has flipped. So...
Good luck! You need that too.
(Or you change the setting in the source code. :P)

Please find some game demo pics in the ~/demo.d/
